# path-equal

## 1.2.9

### Patch Changes

- d54fa3e: Move the TypeScript sources from `ts/` to `src/`.
  
  The published tarball and the JSR package now carry the sources under `src/`
  instead of `ts/`. The `exports` map is unchanged, so `import 'path-equal'` and
  `require('path-equal')` resolve exactly as before; only the path of the shipped
  `.ts` sources moved.

## 1.2.8

### Patch Changes

- e2cb9c7: Serve CJS type declarations to CJS consumers.
  
  The `exports` map carried one top-level `types` pointing at `./esm/index.d.ts`, and no `require` condition. A CommonJS consumer resolving under `node16`/`nodenext` was therefore handed the ESM declarations and told the package was ESM, failing with `TS1479: the referenced file is an ECMAScript module and cannot be imported with 'require'`.
  
  Nothing was wrong with the emitted code — `cjs/package.json` already declares `{"type":"commonjs"}` and `cjs/index.d.ts` already shipped. The manifest simply never pointed at it. `moduleResolution: "node"` ignores `exports` maps entirely, which is why this went unnoticed.
  
  `exports` now resolves `require` and `import` separately, each with the declarations that match its format, and the top-level `types` agrees with `main` instead of contradicting it.

## 1.2.7

### Patch Changes

- 8403d02: Build the published `cjs/` and `esm/` output with tsdown instead of two `tsc` passes.
  
  Every published path is unchanged (`esm/index.js`, `cjs/index.js`, the `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map`
  beside each, and `cjs/package.json`). Two things about the emitted output do change:
  
  - The CJS build targets ES2015 rather than ES5. rolldown's floor is ES2015, and the only
    down-levelled syntax in this package is one arrow function.
  - An `esm/index.js.map` now ships alongside the ESM output. The TypeScript sources already
    shipped, so this adds no information — only a working sourcemap.
  
  Also points `homepage` and `repository` at the repository's current home, `cyberuni/path-equal`.

## 1.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 0d4e3e1: Move the release pipeline to GitHub OIDC trusted publishing on `cyberuni`, removing the
  `NPM_TOKEN` and `CI_GITHUB_TOKEN` dependency, and point the package metadata at the new
  repository home.
